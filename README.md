Real-Time Object Detection for F1 with YOLOv8

This repository demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection in Formula 1 videos. The goal is to leverage AI to detect and analyze key objects such as F1 cars, tyres, pit crew, and other race-related elements with high precision and speed.

Key Features:
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 for high-speed environments.

Custom label mapping tailored for F1-specific objects, such as F1 cars, tyres, pit crew, and more.

Bounding box annotations and confidence scores overlaid on video frames for clear analysis.

Optimized for video analysis in dynamic, fast-moving scenes.

Technologies:
YOLOv8 for advanced object detection.

OpenCV for video handling and real-time annotations.

Python for backend automation and processing.

Use Cases:
Real-time race analysis for teams and analysts.

AI-powered video analytics for identifying key objects during races.

Enhancing race strategy and performance insights by detecting specific events or objects.

General-purpose sports analytics applicable to other fast-paced environments.
